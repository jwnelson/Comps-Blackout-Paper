	abstract = {During entry into the earth's atmosphere of a -ianned or
unmanned space vehicle, a plasma sheath envelope the vehicle due
to shock heating of the ambient gases and ablation of the heat shield
material. This plasma sheath causes the interruption of radio communrications
between the space vehicle and ground based stations
commonly referred to as the reentry communizations blackout. To
solve the blackout problem, a knowledge of the reentry plasma sheath
properties (electron density, electron collision frequency, electron
temperature and plasma stand-off distance) is required. A summary of
the causes and effects of the reentry plasma sheath is presented in
this report together with a discussion of reentry plasma diagnostic
techniques and a review of the flight experiments performed to determine
the properties of the reentry plasma.},
