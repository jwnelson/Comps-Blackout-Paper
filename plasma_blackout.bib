	abstract = {The Optical PAyload for Lasercomm Science (OPALS) experiment was installed on the International Space Station (ISS) in April 2014. Developed as a technology demonstration, its objective was to experiment with space-to-ground optical communications transmissions from Low Earth Orbit. More than a dozen successful optical links were established between a Wrightwood, California–based ground telescope and the OPALS flight terminal from June 2014 to September 2014. Each transmission required precise bi-directional pointing to be maintained between the space-based transmitter and ground-based receiver. This was accomplished by acquiring and tracking a laser beacon signal transmitted from the ground telescope to the OPALS flight terminal on the ISS. OPALS demonstrated the ability to nominally acquire the beacon within three seconds at 25° elevation and maintain lock within 140 μrad (3σ) for the full 150-second transmission duration while slewing at rates up to 1°/sec. Additional acquisition attempts in low elevation and weather-challenged conditions provided valuable insight on the optical link robustness under off-nominal operational conditions.},

The idea is to place a source of an intensive, high frequency electromagnetic pump wave on the vehicle and to use the nonlinearity of the medium to create a backscattered Stokes wave through the interaction of the pump wave with the signal‐carrying wave sent by a ground transmitter. Such an interaction will be mediated by the plasma oscillations generated in the process of the resonant absorption of the signal‐carrying wave. The advantages of this mechanism for information transfer are that the high frequency pump wave only is present in a small region near the vehicle and that the signal wave can have relatively low frequency.},

	abstract = {Reentering hypersonic vehicles become surrounded by a layer of dissociated plasma,
consisting of ions and free electrons, during high-velocity passage through the upper
atmosphere. The ionized layer or sheath can reflect and attenuate propagating
electromagnetic waves severely, causing radio communications to be degraded or
temporarily disrupted. This interruption in signal transmission and reception, or radio
frequency (RF) blackout, is of concern for determination of vehicle position and vehicle
control, key issues affecting public safety, especially for future manned flights where
continuous contact with ground control will be crucial. Causes of RF blackout from plasma
generation around vehicles during hypersonic reentry were reviewed. Methodologies for
mitigating communications blackouts, applicable to reusable launch vehicles (RLVs) for
commercial space, were surveyed. Interactions of RF signals with a known ionized layer,
including reflection, attenuation, refraction, high-power breakdown limits, and effects of the
plasma on antenna characteristics, were explored. RF blackout mitigation strategies fall into
two general classes: passive and active. Passive approaches necessitate design of vehicle
configurations to minimize plasma effects on communications signals. Active approaches
entail manipulation of the plasma conditions and electron density in localized regions
surrounding communication antennas to facilitate RF transmission. Examples of passive
approaches include: using vehicles with leading edges aerodynamically shaped to minimize
plasma generation, designing for communication at higher frequencies, and designing for
radiating higher power from the vehicle. Examples of active approaches include: injection of
electrophilic quenchants or droplets that evaporatively cool the plasma and application of
magnetic fields. The most promising approaches for mitigating the interruption of
communications due to interactions of plasma electrons with RF signals are aerodynamic
shaping, injection of electrophilic quenchants, use of magnetic windows, and use of high
frequencies within the limits imposed by atmospheric attenuation.},

A circular-aperture flush-mounted antenna was used to obtain a comparison between theoretical and experimental antenna admittance in the presence of ionized boundary layers of low collision frequency. The electron-temperature and electron-density distributions in the boundary layer were independently measured. The antenna admittance was measured using a four-probe microwave reflectometer and these measured values were found to be in good agreement with those predicted. Measurements were also performed with another type of circular-aperture antenna and good agreement was obtained between the calculations and the experimental results. A theoretical analysis has been completed which permits calculation of the nonequilibrium, viscous shock-layer flow field for a sphere-cone body. Results are presented for two different bodies at several different altitudes illustrating the influences of bluntness and chemical nonequilibrium on several gas dynamic parameters of interest. Plane-wave transmission coefficients were calculated for an approximate space-shuttle body using a typical trajectory.},
