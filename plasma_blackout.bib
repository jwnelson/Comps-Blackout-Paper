	abstract = {The Optical PAyload for Lasercomm Science (OPALS) experiment was installed on the International Space Station (ISS) in April 2014. Developed as a technology demonstration, its objective was to experiment with space-to-ground optical communications transmissions from Low Earth Orbit. More than a dozen successful optical links were established between a Wrightwood, California–based ground telescope and the OPALS flight terminal from June 2014 to September 2014. Each transmission required precise bi-directional pointing to be maintained between the space-based transmitter and ground-based receiver. This was accomplished by acquiring and tracking a laser beacon signal transmitted from the ground telescope to the OPALS flight terminal on the ISS. OPALS demonstrated the ability to nominally acquire the beacon within three seconds at 25° elevation and maintain lock within 140 μrad (3σ) for the full 150-second transmission duration while slewing at rates up to 1°/sec. Additional acquisition attempts in low elevation and weather-challenged conditions provided valuable insight on the optical link robustness under off-nominal operational conditions.},

solve the blackout problem, a knowledge of the reentry plasma sheath
properties (electron density, electron collision frequency, electron
temperature and plasma stand-off distance) is required. A summary of
the causes and effects of the reentry plasma sheath is presented in
this report together with a discussion of reentry plasma diagnostic
techniques and a review of the flight experiments performed to determine
the properties of the reentry plasma.},

	abstract = {Reentering hypersonic vehicles become surrounded by a layer of dissociated plasma,
consisting of ions and free electrons, during high-velocity passage through the upper
atmosphere. The ionized layer or sheath can reflect and attenuate propagating
electromagnetic waves severely, causing radio communications to be degraded or
temporarily disrupted. This interruption in signal transmission and reception, or radio
frequency (RF) blackout, is of concern for determination of vehicle position and vehicle
control, key issues affecting public safety, especially for future manned flights where
continuous contact with ground control will be crucial. Causes of RF blackout from plasma
generation around vehicles during hypersonic reentry were reviewed. Methodologies for
mitigating communications blackouts, applicable to reusable launch vehicles (RLVs) for
commercial space, were surveyed. Interactions of RF signals with a known ionized layer,
including reflection, attenuation, refraction, high-power breakdown limits, and effects of the
plasma on antenna characteristics, were explored. RF blackout mitigation strategies fall into
two general classes: passive and active. Passive approaches necessitate design of vehicle
configurations to minimize plasma effects on communications signals. Active approaches
entail manipulation of the plasma conditions and electron density in localized regions
surrounding communication antennas to facilitate RF transmission. Examples of passive
approaches include: using vehicles with leading edges aerodynamically shaped to minimize
plasma generation, designing for communication at higher frequencies, and designing for
radiating higher power from the vehicle. Examples of active approaches include: injection of
electrophilic quenchants or droplets that evaporatively cool the plasma and application of
magnetic fields. The most promising approaches for mitigating the interruption of
communications due to interactions of plasma electrons with RF signals are aerodynamic
shaping, injection of electrophilic quenchants, use of magnetic windows, and use of high
frequencies within the limits imposed by atmospheric attenuation.},
